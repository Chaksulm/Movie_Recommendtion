# Movie_Recommendtion
To learn and understand deeply I develop a model that gives recommendation for movies of same genre. I used Pandas to clean dataset which contain 1M+ ratings, more than 1000 movies with various genres. Using Machine Learning concept. On the basis of userâ€™s behavior,  model can give recommendation for movies that user may like to watch using ratings and genres. When user watch action movie and gives rating as 4 it means user like action movies so model will recommend action movies which rated by other user.
